the living room towards the stair they slip and bump into furniture in a mad panic a lamp fall to the floor the light bulb shatters making the room dim to a dark blue the young couple reach the stair and look back they know the whistler can t be far behind steve upstairs he grab janice s hand and pull janice no he ll find u then a crash in the next room it s him he s in the house steve come on we have to go now interior hallway night the couple run looking back with fear interior bedroom night janice and steve crash into the bedroom and slam the door behind them steve get in the closet janice what what about you steve just trust me i have an idea a sobbing janice go to the closet and shuts the door then a loud bash at the bedroom door that shake the room he s at the door steve drop to the floor and slide under the bed the door crash open the silhouette of the whistler fill the frame a slice of moonlight bounce from the blade of his knife eddy park you are a fucking genius the whistler step into the bedroom the floor creak beneath his weight he take a few more step towards the bed just inch from where steve is hiding two whistler slowly scan the room and breathes in then a he always doe before killed he lean his head back and whistle those four sinister note though before the last note ha a chance to trail off into the night steve lunge his arm forward he s gripping a box cutter steve let out a war cry aaah he slice through the whistler s achilles heel the tendon pop and blood spray across the floor and across steve s face the whistler grab at his heel and slip in the pool of blood he hit the floor with a thud his knife slide across the room steve pull himself out from under the bed and rush to the closet he swing the door open and janice dive at steve they embrace it s then she see the whistler on the floor she gasp janice push off steve and move across the room she grab the whistler s knife from off the floor janice go cold she lean her head back and whistle those four note in a flash she plunge the knife deep into the whistler s chest he stiffens and expels his last breath he is dead and fade to motherfucking black well my friend you did it again ahh worthless fucking trash what i said worthless fucking trash i i don t understand clearly there s a lot you don t understand like how to write a decent fuckin violent bloodbath what first of all we need to discus this whistling bullshit is that really the best you can do whistling it s it s just like a a a gimmick you know like like like whistle while you work this is whistle while you kill th that s gonna be the tag line on the poster whistle while you kill i hate it you hate it i have a few other thought let s imagine that the boyfriend character what s his name steve steve let s imagine that before steve make it under the bed i get to him first and i grab him by the back of his stupid steve boyfriend head like this and smash it a hard a i can against the wall or a desk a desk will work fine oh and the box cutter scene i have an idea please stand this isn t happening this can t be happening of course it s happening ed it s happening now shut the fuck up and hear me out now what if the little stevie pull out his box cutter he swing but miss and i go for his wrist no yes and i squeeze it with such force that it break and little stevie fall to the floor like the sack of shit that he is yes just like that i really feel like you re getting the idea really opening up to my vision oh that s right the girl i almost forgot about the girl no janice oh god please don t hurt me please now what if while little stevie lie there helplessly on the ground i take out my knife and gut this poor little thing like a fish no please no please please no please no didn t seem to have any problem doing the same to me isn t that right janice with my own knife no le fucking disrespectful we could end there but i feel like we need a button something to bring it all home this might be a bit much a little bit too gratuitous but let s give it a shot what if i reach deep into her body and pulled out her heart no yeah you re probably right too much hey you know what this wa fun i feel like we got ourselves a pretty good first draft going here you agree yeah i hear you well ed it s been a blast great working with you and i got to say i m already excited to get going on the sequel

like a glass of water or something do you have any wine wine yeah you want wine fuck yeah i do yeah i got wine wine it is ivy s an interesting name is there a um like a story behind it or satan s daughter what really do you believe everything that you re told no i don t believe everything that i m told but i do believe some thing mmm thanks cheer cheer big ear what is that oh it s just something stupid i say it s funny because when i wa a kid people you know what forget it never mind so what d you think of the movie i thought it wa okay yeah i don t know about the whistling thing that whistling thing wa really scary really uh huh i mean do you really want to give that much warning right when you re about to murder somebody i mean whistle a tune shouldn t it be like wham surprise and then you all slit their throat or whatever wow you have really thought this through you have no idea you are very funny and very cool i m having a very good time and i m very glad you said yes mm yeah i m actually surprised you did i m pretty much way out of your league so you are way out of my league oh shut up you are you re you re funny yes and nice mm why wouldn t i say yes um

re mad at me you re offended i can tell i feel like i ve offended you no no no i can t get back there s nothing i can do i m completely not offended really yeah really okay you know the thing about art is that it is really simple it s not about what you see it s about what you feel don t want to leave a stain i believe that art is in everything and everyone it s just that not everything and everyone is being used properly to transmit it power i i have no idea what you re talking about okay for instance this table mm hmm give me your hand you see it a a table because you treat it that way and you are afraid of this wine stain but maybe this wine stain is exactly what this table need to express a feeling and in turn transform this meaningless object into art so i should i should just spill wine all over the table because that s the thing i mean i just it s expensive so i didn t want to ruin it it s not about the table it s about how you feel okay come on come here yeah i ll show you okay now look at me you tell me what you feel i feel like you are pretty interesting smart funny i don t i feel like i m doing this wrong okay hang on um now tell me how you feel what are you doing tell me how you feel i feel like i don t like it i feel nervous and scared can i m anxious i don t like it c can you stop please can you put the knife down please can you put the knife down don t do that can you please stop please please see i just transformed into art i went from a girl to a feeling and you instantly had a visceral emotional response to me that is what good art doe i guess and i could transform you if you let me what wa that relax i wa just trying to make a point i wasn t gonna cut open my throat on your kitchen floor i know that it just i i got um i got a little freaked out i got little scared oh no i don t want you to be scared i want you to be the best that you can be i see great thing in you you could be a rock star my rock star and you could be art if you let me help you really yeah really oh ah i should go no no no no i m sorry i didn t no no it s fine no i thought i mean come on we were weren t we i m not crazy no we we we were we are it s just it s

performance i believed it i m kidding you re great and you shouldn t get into your head i should call marcus that s gonna be a real confidence booster why do you hate him so much uh i don t know it s he s a dick okay he s not a dick he s just he s sensitive okay and he ha trouble communicating in a normal way with like normal people yeah that really explains it besides you know what i m good for him i keep him grounded his ex ivy remember i told you about her she wa a total psycho like spent time in prison total psycho he need me do what you got to do i m gonna get more popcorn get me some no

music i mean fucking really examined it like it s true power here we go no no no no no it s cool it s cool if you guy refuse to go deep like i do i just happen to choose to think about shit like how music is the soundtrack between good and evil and how good and evil are like inextricably linked in a metaphysical battle i m sorry but did you not finish high school no no i didn t finish high school i would expect someone like you to judge me on whether or not i completed some antiquated educational system that teach kid more lie than truth preach let me ask you this what s the happiest chord oh don t ask me i play bass d fucking major say who it doesn t matter who say but you can t deny that certain chord or chord progression can make you feel happy or sad or mad correct yeah well isn t that the whole point of music yeah dude that really isn t all that deep i ll get deep i m just dipping my toe in right now so you won t fucking drown how did i end up in a band with you i fucking love you guy yes yes it s a given that music can produce emotion everyone know that but have you ever really thought about the magical mechanic of that process dude we should call the band magical mechanic i love that i arrange my flesh and bone in a certain pattern and press them against steel string and these string have been tightened or loosened to such a degree that it creates a blending of sound that somehow over thousand of year we a human have decided made sense and then that sound travel through an electric cord through a wooden box and then out a man made speaker and then the sound travel through the air and into your ear vibrating a piece of fucking cartilage sending signal instantaneously through million no billion of neuron where where nerve cell connect to synapsis and then stimulates a fucking emotion an emotion you guy i cry every time i hear nothing compare to you she cry every time she hears nothing compare to you okay you still haven t said anything i didn t already know okay class what if i told you that stimulating an emotion wa just the beginning the most rudimentary of function you guy ever heard about the brown note supposedly it make you shit your pant i m serious the military discovered it or something what if i told you that the power of music in sound is limitless and i ve figured out how to harness it then why aren t we famous yet i m not talking about writing a three minute pop song i m talking about note combination that can transform consciousness note that can infiltrate the psyche of a sane human being and unravel them into madness dude how fucking high are you wait how did you figure all this out okay well i i haven t figured it out completely but i have figured out how to exactly there it is i call bullshit i have figured out a sequence of six note that if played it correctly will manifest evil i think black sabbath figured that out like year ago that s funny alright i got to get out of here guy i m fucking beat i m with you

i to asta and the way i still am to her memory i i she died a long time ago i i and after so many decade i i it s hard for me to shed this skin i i because it reminds me of the way thing used to be i i before everything changed i i dramatic music i i brown bird s bilgewater i i laid back acoustic strumming i i offspring on my planet do not form attachment i i that is a purely human trait i i so it wa obviously the weaker human side of the baby i i which made him listen to max s friend i i that meat sack wrapped in child s clothing i sniffing i she told him to run away from me i i but i have something she doe not i i i speak the baby s language i i imitating bird call i bird chirping water trickling i feel like erin brockovich testing water and solving crime maybe one day they ll make a

environment even this model they provided is made from recycled wine cork and cd and diaper oh is that why it stink oh ho ho ho baby you tell him hey sorry sir hey i wa skeptical too but then i realized how much good this resort could do for the town the revenue that it brings in will bolster the public service in patience like the school new book an athletic field not to mention law enforcement i mean when this resort come in we ll have the manpower to protect everybody in town just think of it for a second hour surveillance on every citizen in patience what absolutely not what we would ever want uh is is what we could do but won t do of course because we don t live in a police state not yet never someday soon no okay everyone is here except harry where is he i it is happening too fast i i i came here to kill all the human i i but i could feel myself i i wanting to help asta s ski friend i i it is bad enough that i never fried their body to ash i i today i wa trying to make her human life better i i what have i become i i i have been hiding behind this human mask for too long i i being in human form must be allowing emotion i i to take over i i the only way to fight it is to return to my alien body i i and live the way i wa born to live i i in my familiar frozen environment i i a an alien i i i did not consider there is no food up here i i and i am already hungry i i alien can also live in cabin with meat freezer i hmm i quirky music i we can t let this resort happen my dad s right if they put a resort in here you can just say goodbye to joe s diner the all the money s gonna go to big corporation it s never gonna trickle down to the local if they widen the road the first thing that s gonna go is old barrett bridge we have to do something you were so great out there honey so in command very sexy i don t know it felt like there were a lot of people against it but there s also a lot of people for it that s just the way it is when you became mayor you didn t have of the people behind you no not even close only of the town actually voted really yeah i won with vote and i think of those were hawthorne so only nine people outside my family voted for me actually i voted for myself so that s eight everyone hate me honey they they don t hate you okay some just have a different opinion about what s best for the town a lot of some a few of them believed in you a mayor and now it is time for you to guide them okay so ignore everyone who disagrees with you and do what you think is best for the town i mean i think the resort is great for the town you know it s something that everyone can be proud of then you re doing the right thing yeah thanks hon i like this you know we we re a team hell yeah we are nothing can stop u i

everyone is being used properly to transmit it power i i have no idea what you re talking about okay for instance this table mm hmm give me your hand you see it a a table because you treat it that way and you are afraid of this wine stain but maybe this wine stain is exactly what this table need to express a feeling and in turn transform this meaningless object into art so i should i should just spill wine all over the table because that s the thing i mean i just it s expensive so i didn t want to ruin it it s not about the table it s about how you feel okay come on come here yeah i ll show you okay now look at me you tell me what you feel i feel like you are pretty interesting smart funny i don t i feel like i m doing this wrong okay hang on um now tell me how you feel what are you

handful of people so it s actually a pretty big deal why are you wasting your time with that shit it s not art it s pretend really i mean you know i m over here struggling to sketch the flow that s already intact within the mind and you re playing dress up yeah and you re a fucking snob so well if a snob is someone who pours their soul out onto the ground to be stepped on by zombie or dullard then yeah i m a snob whatever marcus i just want to act you want to be famous alright yeah i m i m gonna go okay that s your man what and that s your man hey let s go and celebrate i can t i have band practice no but when i get back we can and i ll get you ready to act the shit out of that acting class tomorrow promise promise whoo goddamn fucking music right i mean have you ever really examined music i mean fucking really examined it like it s true power here we go no no no no no it s cool it s cool if you guy refuse to go deep like i do i just happen to choose to think about shit like how music is the soundtrack between good and evil and how good and evil are like inextricably linked in a metaphysical battle i m sorry but did you not finish high school no no i didn t finish high school i would expect someone like you to judge me on whether or not i completed some antiquated educational system that teach kid more lie than truth preach let me ask you this what s the happiest chord oh don t ask me i play bass d fucking major say who it doesn t matter who say but you can t deny that certain chord or chord progression can make you feel happy or sad or mad correct yeah well isn t that the whole point of music yeah dude that really isn t all that deep i ll get deep i m just dipping my toe in right now so you won t fucking drown how did i end up in a band with you i fucking love you guy yes yes it s a given that music can produce emotion everyone know that but have you ever really thought about the magical mechanic of that process dude we should call the band magical mechanic i love that i arrange my flesh and bone in a certain pattern and press them against steel string and these string have been tightened or loosened to such a degree that it creates a blending of sound that somehow over thousand of year we a human have decided made sense and then that sound travel through an electric cord through a wooden box and then out a man made speaker and then the sound travel through the air and into your ear vibrating a piece of fucking cartilage sending signal instantaneously through million no billion of neuron where where nerve cell connect to synapsis and then stimulates a fucking emotion an emotion you guy i cry every time i hear nothing compare to you she cry every time she hears nothing compare to you okay you still haven t said anything i didn t already know okay class what if i told you that stimulating an emotion wa just the beginning the most rudimentary of function you guy ever heard about the brown note supposedly it make you shit your pant i m serious the military discovered it or something what if i told you that the power of music in sound is limitless and i ve figured out how to harness it then why aren t we famous yet i m not talking about writing a three minute pop song i m talking about note combination that can transform consciousness note that can infiltrate the psyche of a sane human being and unravel them into madness dude how fucking high are you wait how did you figure all this out okay well i i haven t figured it out completely but i have figured out how to exactly there it is i call bullshit i have figured out a sequence of six note that if played it correctly will manifest evil i think black sabbath figured that out like year ago that s funny alright i got to get out of here guy i m fucking beat i m with you it s been interesting a always bro mm lightning so what are the six note it s not that easy i mean it s complicated you have to be they have to be played in a particular way like i said bullshit come

forced to use harry vanderspeigle s body i i to blend in i i but over time that body changed i i from just being a way of hiding i i to who i became i i and i am attached to it the way i wa attached i i to asta and the way i still am to her memory i i she died a long time ago i i and after so many decade i i it s hard for me to shed this skin i i because it reminds me of the way thing used to be i i before everything changed i i dramatic music i i brown bird s bilgewater i i laid back acoustic strumming i i offspring on my planet do not form attachment i i that is a purely human trait i i so it wa obviously the weaker human side of the baby i i which made him listen to max s friend i i that meat sack wrapped in child s clothing i sniffing i she told him to run away from me i i but i have something she doe not i i i speak the baby s language i i imitating bird call i bird chirping water trickling i feel like erin brockovich testing water and solving crime maybe one day they ll make a movie about me hmm you know if they do make a movie i want to play myself a handsome rugged sheriff keeping the street safe in a quaint colorado town right until bigfoot show up to kill everybody but i recognize his beautiful soul and i teach him to speak english he teach me how to play the guitar see that s a movie that sound like a movie that s about just you and it ha nothing to do with environmental justice it s gotta do with america wanting to see me sing a duet with bigfoot my god that s off the chart yup this water s poison maybe we should take a look at a map and see what s upstream that could cause this no police work ain t done with no map it s more tactile police work is done in the real world come on let s go hey you know what maybe in my movie i got a trusty sidekick right who doe all the paperwork and i m just spit balling here right but maybe she provides comic relief cause she s always bumping into thing you see you see how i said she right that s

pretending that this gentleman worked at a grocery store before he wa murdered cool look i need more information on this alien race that you said is trying to take over the earth you know i wa on the internet the other day and there s something called insectoids like a big giant bug person alien thing i i what the hell i do not want to be squashed by a big bug person the internet is wrong oh okay good no the insectoids they do not squash they like to eat other being while they are still alive and struggling chuckle you re not helping there are so many alien race there are tall white arcturians there are blue avians which are very beautiful if you are attracted to bird face which of course i am i will not know which alien race is here until i receive the rest of goliath s message you can thank max s stupid friend for interfering you can t blame sahar she wa just trying to take care of the baby i wa taking care of it first it should have jumped into my arm when i did my alien call well

inevitable i mean look at what happened to goliath he wa an alien and look how human he became no i am an alien that is who i am on the inside goliath wa weak i am not a long a i am on this planet i

okay me and my butt will do it it seems the pond is owned by a shell company controlled by the galvan powell group which we know wa the same company tanner corrington worked for apparently the tainted water is leaking heavy metal into hawthorne creek which explains the symptom we found in the medical file in corrington s car okay so what doe this have to do with sam s murder yeah this corrington guy obviously knew his company wa responsible and tried to cover it up but sam must have figured it out based on his patient illness yeah we believe tanner corrington tried to shut sam up and when sam refused to play ball he killed him and stole his medical file so what next sheriff how are you gonna get justice for sam the case is being kicked up the ladder to the fbi yeah but the galvan powell group they re done for there s going to be lawsuit people are going to be getting fired people going to jail mm hmm except we won t get credit for that you know we did all the hard work now the fbi s going to come in and just reach into our pant and rip off our bean bag oh not me i don t have a bean bag well not on the outside i don t really know what that mean well i am so sorry you re not gonna

all what i said i agree traffic is tourism nope which is money in the pocket of local business owner until all the small business get pushed out by the bigger chain won t allow it or we die because the resort destroys our environment exactly big business already poisoned hawthorne creek yes thank you all murmuring i see word ha gotten out about that and trust me a a hawthorne i take the poisoning of hawthorne creek very personally also unrelated i would like to make a motion to rename the creek any seconder this isn t a court of law hmm all right stay on point sure yeah look what happened at the creek to be renamed is exactly why we need this resort we can use the money it brings in to help clean the creek and green soul property is known for their commitment to the environment even this model they provided is made from recycled wine cork and cd and diaper oh is that why it stink oh ho ho ho baby you tell him hey sorry sir hey i wa skeptical too but then i realized how much good this resort could do for the town the revenue that it brings in will bolster the public service in patience like the school new book an athletic field not to mention law enforcement i mean when this resort come in we ll have the manpower to protect everybody in town just think of it for a second hour surveillance on every citizen in patience what absolutely not what we would ever want uh is is what we could do but won t do of course because we don t live in a police state not yet never someday soon no okay everyone is here except harry where is he i it is happening too fast i i i came here to kill all the human i i but i could feel myself i i wanting to help asta s ski friend i i it is bad enough that i never fried their body to ash i i today i wa trying to make her human life better i i what have i become i i i have been hiding behind this human mask for too long i i being in human form must be allowing emotion i i to take over i i the only way to fight it is to return to my alien body i i and live the way i wa born to live i i in my familiar frozen environment i i a an alien i i i did not consider there is no food up here i i and i am already hungry i i alien can also live in cabin with meat freezer i hmm i quirky music i we can t let this resort happen my dad s right if they put a resort in here you can just say goodbye to joe s

became mayor you didn t have of the people behind you no not even close only of the town actually voted really yeah i won with vote and i think of those were hawthorne so only nine people outside my family voted for me actually i voted for myself so that s eight everyone hate me honey they they don t hate you okay some just have a different opinion about what s best for the town a lot of some a few of them believed in you a mayor and now it is time for you to guide them okay so ignore everyone who disagrees with you and do what you think is best for the town i mean i think the resort is

the living room towards the stair they slip and bump into furniture in a mad panic a lamp fall to the floor the light bulb shatters making the room dim to a dark blue the young couple reach the stair and look back they know the whistler can t be far behind steve upstairs he grab janice s hand and pull janice no he ll find u then a crash in the next room it s him he s in the house steve come on we have to go now interior hallway night the couple run looking back with fear interior bedroom night janice and steve crash into the bedroom and slam the door behind them steve get in the closet janice what what about you steve just trust me i have an idea a sobbing janice go to the closet and shuts the door then a loud bash at the bedroom door that shake the room he s at the door steve drop to the floor and slide under the bed the door crash open the silhouette of the whistler fill the frame a slice of moonlight bounce from the blade of his knife eddy park you are a fucking genius the whistler step into the bedroom the floor creak beneath his weight he take a few more step towards the bed just inch from where steve is hiding two whistler slowly scan the room and breathes in then a he always doe before killed he lean his head back and whistle those four sinister note though before the last note ha a chance to trail off into the night steve lunge his arm forward he s gripping a box cutter steve let out a war cry aaah he slice through the whistler s achilles heel the tendon pop and blood spray across the floor and across steve s face the whistler grab at his heel and slip in the pool of blood he hit the floor with a thud his knife slide across the room steve pull himself out from under the bed and rush to the closet he swing the door open and janice dive at steve they embrace it s then she see the whistler on the floor she gasp janice push off steve and move across the room she grab the whistler s knife from off the floor janice go cold she lean her head back and whistle those four note in a flash she plunge the knife deep into the whistler s chest he stiffens and expels his last breath he is dead and fade to motherfucking black well my friend you did it again ahh worthless fucking trash what i said worthless fucking trash i i don t understand clearly there s a lot you don t understand like how to write a decent fuckin violent bloodbath what first of all we need to discus this whistling bullshit is that really the best you can do whistling it s it s just like a a a gimmick you know like like like whistle while you work this is whistle while you kill th that s gonna be the tag line on the poster whistle while you kill i hate it you hate it i have a few other thought let s imagine that the boyfriend character what s his name steve steve let s imagine that before steve make it under the bed i get to him first and i grab him by the back of his stupid steve boyfriend head like this and smash it a hard a i can against the wall or a desk a desk will work fine oh and the box cutter scene i have an idea please stand this isn t happening this can t be happening of course it s happening ed it s happening now shut the fuck up and hear me out now what if the little stevie pull out his box cutter he swing but miss and i go for his wrist no yes and i squeeze it with such force that it break and little stevie fall to the floor like the sack of shit that he is yes just like that i really feel like you re getting the idea really opening up to my vision oh that s right the girl i almost forgot about the girl no janice oh god please don t hurt me please now what if while little stevie lie there helplessly on the ground i take out my knife and gut this poor little thing like a fish no please no please please no please no didn t seem to have any problem doing the same to me isn t that right janice with my own knife no le fucking disrespectful we could end there but i feel like we need a button something to bring it all home this might be a bit much a little bit too gratuitous but let s give it a shot what if i reach deep into her body and pulled out her heart no yeah you re probably right too much hey you know what this wa fun i feel

like a glass of water or something do you have any wine wine yeah you want wine fuck yeah i do yeah i got wine wine it is ivy s an interesting name is there a um like a story behind it or satan s daughter what really do you believe everything that you re told no i don t believe everything that i m told but i do believe some thing mmm thanks cheer cheer big ear what is that oh it s just something stupid i say it s funny because when i wa a kid people you know what forget it never mind so what d you think of the movie i thought it wa okay yeah i don t know about the whistling thing that whistling thing wa really scary really uh huh i mean do you really want to give that much warning right when you re about to murder somebody i mean whistle a tune shouldn t it be like wham surprise and then you all slit their throat or whatever wow you have really thought this through you have no idea you are very funny and very cool i m having a very good time and i m very glad you said yes mm yeah i m actually surprised you did i m pretty much way out of your league so you are way out of my league oh shut up you are you re you re funny yes and nice mm why wouldn t i say yes um

re mad at me you re offended i can tell i feel like i ve offended you no no no i can t get back there s nothing i can do i m completely not offended really yeah really okay you know the thing about art is that it is really simple it s not about what you see it s about what you feel don t want to leave a stain i believe that art is in everything and everyone it s just that not everything and everyone is being used properly to transmit it power i i have no idea what you re talking about okay for instance this table mm hmm give me your hand you see it a a table because you treat it that way and you are afraid of this wine stain but maybe this wine stain is exactly what this table need to express a feeling and in turn transform this meaningless object into art so i should i should just spill wine all over the table because that s the thing i mean i just it s expensive so i didn t want to ruin it it s not about the table it s about how you feel okay come on come here yeah i ll show you okay now look at me you tell me what you feel i feel like you are pretty interesting smart funny i don t i feel like i m doing this wrong okay hang on um now tell me how you feel what are you doing tell me how you feel i feel like i don t like it i feel nervous and scared can i m anxious i don t like it c can you stop please can you put the knife down please can you put the knife down don t do that can you please stop please please see i just transformed into art i went from a girl to a feeling and you instantly had a visceral emotional response to me that is what good art doe i guess and i could transform you if you let me what wa that relax i wa just trying to make a point i wasn t gonna cut open my throat on your kitchen floor i know that it just i i got um i got a little freaked out i got little scared oh no i don t want you to be scared i want you to be the best that you can be i see great thing in you you could be a rock star my rock star and you could be art if you

music i mean fucking really examined it like it s true power here we go no no no no no it s cool it s cool if you guy refuse to go deep like i do i just happen to choose to think about shit like how music is the soundtrack between good and evil and how good and evil are like inextricably linked in a metaphysical battle i m sorry but did you not finish high school no no i didn t finish high school i would expect someone like you to judge me on whether or not i completed some antiquated educational system that teach kid more lie than truth preach let me ask you this what s the happiest chord oh don t ask me i play bass d fucking major say who it doesn t matter who say but you can t deny that certain chord or chord progression can make you feel happy or sad or mad correct yeah well isn t that the whole point of music yeah dude that really isn t all that deep i ll get deep i m just dipping my toe in right now so you won t fucking drown how did i end up in a band with you i fucking love you guy yes yes it s a given that music can produce emotion everyone know that but have you ever really thought about the magical mechanic of that process dude we should call the band magical mechanic i love that i arrange my flesh and bone in a certain pattern and press them against steel string and these string have been tightened or loosened to such a degree that it creates a blending of sound that somehow over thousand of year we a human have decided made sense and then that sound travel through an electric cord through a wooden box and then out a man made speaker and then the sound travel through the air and into your ear vibrating a piece of fucking cartilage sending signal instantaneously through million no billion of neuron where where nerve cell connect to synapsis and then stimulates a fucking emotion an emotion you guy i cry every time i hear nothing compare to you she cry every time she hears nothing compare to you okay you still haven t said anything i didn t already know okay class what if i told you that stimulating an emotion wa just the beginning the most rudimentary of function you guy ever heard about the brown note supposedly it make you shit your pant i m serious the military discovered it or something what if i told you that the power of music in sound is limitless and i ve figured out how to harness it then why aren t we famous yet i m not talking about writing a three minute pop song i m talking about note combination that can transform consciousness note that can infiltrate the psyche of a sane human being and unravel them into madness dude how fucking high are you wait how did you figure all this out okay well i i haven t figured it out completely but i have figured out how to exactly there it is i call bullshit i have figured out a sequence of six note that if played it correctly will manifest evil i think black sabbath figured that out like year ago that s funny alright i got to get out of here guy i m fucking beat i m with you

forced to use harry vanderspeigle s body i i to blend in i i but over time that body changed i i from just being a way of hiding i i to who i became i i and i am attached to it the way i wa attached i i to asta and the way i still am to her memory i i she died a long time ago i i and after so many decade i i it s hard for me to shed this skin i i because it reminds me of the way thing used to be i i before everything changed i i dramatic music i i brown bird s bilgewater i i laid back acoustic strumming i i offspring on my planet do not form attachment i i that is a purely human trait i i so it wa obviously the weaker human side of the baby i i which made him listen to max s friend i i that meat sack wrapped in child s clothing i sniffing i she told him to run away from me i i but i have something she doe not i i i speak the baby s language i i imitating bird call i bird chirping water trickling i feel like erin brockovich testing water and solving crime maybe one day they ll make a

i recognize his beautiful soul and i teach him to speak english he teach me how to play the guitar see that s a movie that sound like a movie that s about just you and it ha nothing to do with environmental justice it s gotta do with america wanting to see me sing a duet with bigfoot my god that s off the chart yup this water s poison maybe we should take a look at a map and see what s upstream that could cause this no police work ain t done with no map it s more tactile police work is done in the real world come on let s go hey you know what maybe in my movie i got a trusty

there are blue avians which are very beautiful if you are attracted to bird face which of course i am i will not know which alien race is here until i receive the rest of goliath s message you can thank max s stupid friend for interfering you can t blame sahar she wa just trying to take care of the baby i wa taking care of it first it should have jumped into my arm when i did my alien call well

inevitable i mean look at what happened to goliath he wa an alien and look how human he became no i am an alien that is who i am on the inside goliath wa weak i am not a long a i am on this planet i

okay me and my butt will do it it seems the pond is owned by a shell company controlled by the galvan powell group which we know wa the same company tanner corrington worked for apparently the tainted water is leaking heavy metal into hawthorne creek which explains the symptom we found in the medical file in corrington s car okay so what doe this have to do with sam s murder yeah this corrington guy obviously knew his company wa responsible and tried to cover it up but sam must have figured it out based on his patient illness yeah we believe tanner corrington tried to shut sam up and when sam refused to play ball he killed him and stole his medical file so what next sheriff how are you gonna get justice for sam the case is being kicked up the ladder to the fbi yeah but the galvan powell group they re done for there s going to be lawsuit people are going to be getting fired people going to jail mm hmm except we won t get credit for that you know we did all the hard work now the fbi s going to come in and just reach into our pant and rip off our bean bag oh not me i don t have a bean bag well not on the outside i don t really know what that mean well i am so sorry you re not gonna

think you you had a question yeah what about traffic yes isn t main street gonna be wall to wall car yes i agree with our great olympic hero d arcy bloom more traffic is great news for patience not at all what i said i agree traffic is tourism nope which is money in the pocket of local business owner until all the small business get pushed out by the bigger chain won t allow it or we die because the resort destroys our environment exactly big business already poisoned hawthorne creek yes thank you all murmuring i see word ha gotten out about that and trust me a a hawthorne i take the poisoning of hawthorne creek very personally also unrelated i would like to make a motion to rename the creek any seconder this isn t a court of law hmm all right stay on point sure yeah look what happened at the creek to be renamed is exactly why we need this resort we can use the money it brings in to help clean the creek and green soul property is known for their commitment to the environment even this model they provided is made from recycled wine cork and cd and diaper oh is that why it stink oh ho ho ho baby you tell him hey sorry sir hey i wa skeptical too but then i realized how much good this resort could do for the town the revenue that it brings in will bolster the public service in patience like the school new book an athletic field not to mention law enforcement i mean when this resort come in we ll have the manpower to protect everybody in town just think of it for a second hour surveillance on every citizen in patience what absolutely not what we would ever want uh is is what we could do but won t do of course because we don t live in a police state not yet never someday soon no okay everyone is here except harry where is he i it is happening too fast i i i came here to kill all the human i i but i could feel myself i i wanting to help asta s ski friend i i it is bad enough that i never fried their body to ash i i today i wa trying to make her human life better i i what have i become i i i have been hiding behind this human mask for too long i i being in human form must be allowing emotion i i to take over i i the only way to fight it is to return to my alien body i i and live the way i wa born to live i i in my familiar frozen environment i i a an alien i i i did not consider there is no food up here i i and i am already hungry i i alien can also live in cabin with meat freezer i hmm i quirky music i we can t let this resort happen my dad s right if they put a resort in here you can just say goodbye to joe s diner the all the money s gonna go to big corporation it s never gonna trickle down to the local if they widen the road the first thing that s gonna go is old barrett bridge we have to do something

became mayor you didn t have of the people behind you no not even close only of the town actually voted really yeah i won with vote and i think of those were hawthorne so only nine people outside my family voted for me actually i voted for myself so that s eight everyone hate me honey they they don t hate you okay some just have a different opinion about what s best for the town a lot of some a few of them believed in you a mayor and now it is time for you to guide them okay so ignore everyone who disagrees with you and do what you think is best for the town i mean i think the resort is

beneath his weight he take a few more step towards the bed just inch from where steve is hiding two whistler slowly scan the room and breathes in then a he always doe before killed he lean his head back and whistle those four sinister note though before the last note ha a chance to trail off into the night steve lunge his arm forward he s gripping a box cutter steve let out a war cry aaah he slice through the whistler s achilles heel the tendon pop and blood spray across the floor and across steve s face the whistler grab at his heel and slip in the pool of blood he hit the floor with a

poster whistle while you kill i hate it you hate it i have a few other thought let s imagine that the boyfriend character what s his name steve steve let s imagine that before steve make it under the bed i get to him first and i grab him by the back of his stupid steve boyfriend head like this and smash it a hard a i can against the wall or a desk a desk will work fine oh and the box cutter scene

about what you see it s about what you feel don t want to leave a stain i believe that art is in everything and everyone it s just that not everything and everyone is being used properly to transmit it power i i have no idea what you re talking about okay for instance this table mm hmm give me your hand you see it a a table because you treat it that way and you are afraid of this wine stain but maybe this wine stain is exactly what this table need to express a feeling and in turn transform this meaningless object into art so i should i should just spill wine all over the table because that s the thing i mean i just it s expensive so i didn t want to ruin it it s not about the table it s about how you feel okay come on come here yeah i ll show you okay now look at me you tell me what you feel i feel like you are pretty interesting smart funny i don t i feel like i m doing this wrong okay hang on um now tell me how you feel what are you doing tell me how you feel i feel like i don t

some antiquated educational system that teach kid more lie than truth preach let me ask you this what s the happiest chord oh don t ask me i play bass d fucking major say who it doesn t matter who say

get deep i m just dipping my toe in right now so you won t fucking drown how did i end up in a band with you i fucking love you guy yes yes it s a given that music can produce emotion everyone know that but have you ever really thought about the magical mechanic of that process dude we should call the band magical mechanic i love that i arrange my flesh and bone in a certain pattern and press them against steel string and these string have been tightened or loosened to such a degree that it creates a blending of sound that somehow over thousand of year we a human have decided made sense and then that sound travel through an electric cord through a wooden box and then out a man made speaker and then the sound travel through the air and into your ear vibrating a piece of fucking cartilage sending signal instantaneously through million no billion of neuron where where nerve cell connect to synapsis and then stimulates a fucking emotion an emotion you guy i cry every time i

everything changed i i dramatic music i i brown bird s bilgewater i i laid back acoustic strumming i i offspring on my planet do not form attachment i i that is a purely human trait i i so it wa obviously the weaker human side of the baby i i which made him listen to max s friend i i that meat sack wrapped in child s clothing i sniffing i she told him to run away from me i i but i have something she doe not i i i speak the baby s language i i imitating bird call i bird chirping water trickling i feel like erin brockovich testing water and solving crime maybe one day they ll make a movie about me hmm you know if they do make a movie i want to play myself a handsome rugged sheriff keeping the street safe in a quaint colorado town right until bigfoot show up to kill everybody but i recognize his beautiful soul and i teach him to speak english he teach me how to play the guitar see that s a movie that sound like a movie that s about just you and it ha nothing to do with environmental justice it s gotta do with america wanting to see me sing a duet with bigfoot my god that s off the chart yup this water s poison maybe we should take a look at a map and see what s upstream that could cause this no police work ain t done with no map it s more tactile police work is done in the real world come on let s go hey you know what maybe in my movie i got a trusty

thank max s stupid friend for interfering you can t blame sahar she wa just trying to take care of the baby i wa taking care of it first it should have jumped into my arm when i did my alien call well

inevitable i mean look at what happened to goliath he wa an alien and look how human he became no i am an alien that is who i am on the inside goliath wa weak i am not a long a i am on this planet i

okay me and my butt will do it it seems the pond is owned by a shell company controlled by the galvan powell group which we know wa the same company tanner corrington worked for apparently the tainted water is leaking heavy metal into hawthorne creek which explains the symptom we found in the medical file in corrington s car okay so what doe this have to do with sam s murder yeah this corrington guy obviously knew his company wa responsible and tried to cover it up but sam must have figured it out based on his patient illness yeah we believe tanner corrington tried to shut sam up and when sam refused to play ball he killed him and stole his medical file so what next sheriff how are you gonna get justice for sam the case is being kicked up the ladder to the fbi yeah but the galvan powell group they re done for there s going to be lawsuit people are going to be getting fired people going to jail mm hmm except we won t get credit for that you know we did all the hard work now the fbi s

the resort destroys our environment exactly big business already poisoned hawthorne creek yes thank you all murmuring i see word ha gotten out about that and trust me a a hawthorne i take the poisoning of hawthorne creek very personally also unrelated i would like to make a motion to rename the creek any seconder this isn t a court of law hmm all right stay on point sure yeah look what happened at the creek to be renamed is exactly why we need this resort we can use the money it brings in to help clean the creek and green soul property is known for their commitment to the environment even this model they provided is made from recycled wine cork and cd and diaper oh is that why it stink oh ho ho ho baby you tell him hey sorry sir hey i wa skeptical too but then i realized how much good this resort could do for the town the revenue that it brings in will bolster the public service in patience like the school new book an athletic field not to mention law enforcement i mean when this resort come in we ll have the manpower to protect everybody in town just think of it for a second hour surveillance on every citizen in patience what absolutely not what we would ever want uh is is what we could do but won t do of course because we don t live in a police state not yet never someday soon no okay everyone is here except harry where is he i it is happening too fast i i i came here to kill all the human i i but i could feel myself i i wanting to help asta s ski friend i i it is bad enough that i never fried their body to ash i i today i wa trying to make her human life better i i what have i become i i i have been hiding behind this human mask for too long i i being in human form must be allowing emotion i i to take over i i the only way to fight it is to return to my alien body i i and live the way i wa born to live i i in my familiar frozen environment i i a an alien i i i did not consider there is no food up here i i and i am already hungry i i alien can also live in cabin with meat freezer i hmm i quirky music i we can t let this resort happen my dad s right if they put a resort in here you can just say goodbye to joe s

family voted for me actually i voted for myself so that s eight everyone hate me honey they they don t hate you okay some just have a different opinion about what s best for the town a lot of some a few of them believed in you a mayor and now it is time for you to guide them okay so ignore everyone who disagrees with you and do what you think is best for the town i mean i think the resort is
